### How it operates
It is actually pretty simple and I was surprised that no other jelbrake didn't use this method.
1. The gr4p3_ju1c3 app takes a full backup of your device
2. A promt to install your jb-manager (Cydia/Sileo/Zebra) at a root level is injected in the backup-data
3. The modded Backup gets installed and your device reboots
  Done. You are now Jelbricken

### Which ios version does it work on?

  - Also all the ios 18 beta versions included
